# CaPP 1.0
Calculating Pair distance distribution functions (PDDF) for Proteins.  
The program calculates the PDDF from a high-resolution protein structure in PDB format,  
and the scattering intensity can be calculated by Fourier transform of the PDDF.  
A water layer can be added as an option.

## Dependencies

### Dependencies for the GUI  
- python 2.7  
- wxpython 2.9
- matplotlib  
tested on MacOS 10.12 under Enthought Canopy 2.7 (64-bit)   
and with python under cygwin on windows 7 (no build-in plotting available)  

##### Windows: in cygwin terminal, type:  
    $ wget.exe http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py  
    $ python ez_setup.py  
    $ easy_install pip  
    $ pip.exe install wxpython  
    $ pip.exe install matplotlib  

### Dependencies for developers and users of Linux
- To recompile the source code, a c-compiler is needed,  
e.g. gcc (Linux/MacOS) and Pelles C (Windows).  

### Different platforms  
Executables have been made for MacOS and Windows  
Users of other OS should:  
1) compile MainFunction.c and call the executable "capp"  
        >> gcc MainFunction.c -o capp  -lm
2) place the executable, capp, in the same folder as CaPP.py  
3) Run CaPP  

        >> python CaPP_1.0.py  

CaPP has been tested on  
- MacOS 10.12 (Sierra), compiled with gcc
- Windows Vista and Windows 7, compiled with Pelles C  
- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, compiled with gcc  

## Running the program

### Running the program, GUI mode
To start the GUI, type in the terminal

        >> python CaPP_1.0.py  

### Running the program, batch mode
Type in the terminal  

        >> capp [options] PDBFILE.pdb  
  
##### Options:  
  
- c [input: Contrast of water layer]  
Add a water layer with (c)ontrast between 0 and 2 times the solvent scattering length.  
Typically 0.1.  
Default: No water layer. 
  
- d [no input]  
Only relevant for membrane proteins.  
Removes water layer from the bilayer region.  
Choose -d if the pdb is from the OPM (d)atabase, that provides the bilayer thickness.  
  
- m [input: Bilayer Thickness]  
Only relevant for membrane proteins.  
Removes water layer from the bilayer region.  
Choose -m to (m)anually provide the bilayer thickness in Aangstrom.  
Typically 30 Aangstrom.  
NB: Remember to place the TMD perpendicular to the xy-plane, in z=0!
  
- s [input: prc D20 in the solvent]  
Choose SANS contrast and enter the D2O-content (between 0 and 1) of the (s)olvent.  
SAXS contrast asssumed if option is not chosen.  
  
- r [input: Resolution of p(r) function]  
Change the (r)esolution, i.e. the binsize (in Aangstrom) of the p(r) function.  
Default: 3.0 Aangstrom. 

##### Example:  

        >> capp -c 0.1 -m 30 -s 0.4 -r 2.0 4u2p.pdb  

## Output
assuming ABC.pdb as input pdb file  

##### ABC_w.pdb  
A new pdb with water beads added as lines to ABC.pdb (after CONNECT, before END), e.g. 

    ATOM  26485  Q   WAT W1497     -24.394   2.153 -28.888  1.00 10.00           Q  
    
##### ABC_w_only.pdb  
A pdb file with the water bead lines only (for visualization, e.g. in PyMOL)  

##### ABC_pr.dat/ABC_w_pr.dat
A data files with the PDDF for the pdb file without/with water layer, columns:  
1. r     = pair distance  
2. P(r)  = PDDF = sum ( dBa(i) * dBa(j) ) for i \neq j  
3. G(r)  = sum ( Ba(i) * Ba(j) )  
4. H(r)  = sum ( Ba(i) * Ba(j) )  
5. J(r)  = sum ( Ba(i) * Ba(j) )  
6. K(r)  = sum ( Ba(i) * Ba(j) )  

where  
Ba[i]: scattering length of atom i  
Bs[i]: scattering length of solvent, excluded by atom i  
dB[i]: excess scattering length of atom i  
columns 3-6 used only to calculate th form factor P(q)  
(optional, see CaPP_A.B.py for details)    

##### ABC_Pq  
A datafile with the form factor for the protein  

## About the calculations
The PDDF is calculated using the positions of each atom in the PDB file.  

X-ray scattering length are calculated as the number of electrons times the electron scattering length. 

The atomic form factor of each atom is approximated by the carbon atomic formfactor. 

The form factor of the excluded solvent is given as a Gaussian sphere with volume equal to the atomic volume.  
The Van der Waals radii are used for most atoms, except the volumes for H,C,D,N, and O, which are found  
experimentally for proteins by Fraser et al. (J. Appl. Cryst.(1978), 11, 693).  

Neutron scattering length are imported from the ILL neutron data booklet, and the nucleai are assumed to be  
point-like, i.e. with form factor of unity.  

The hydrogens and deuteriums are included implicitely. This is done for the 20 natural amino acids and the  
hetero atoms currently included in the HETATM library (MainFunction.c). If a hetero atom in the PDB does not  
exist in the library, no H's or D's will be added. The H's and D's are added according to the Protein Data  
Base (www4.rcsb.org/ligand/).  

If chosen, a water layer is added explicitely and included in the PDDF and thus in the calculated scattering  
intensity.
